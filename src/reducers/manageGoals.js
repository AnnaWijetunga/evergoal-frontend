// a reducer is a function and reducers exist in-between our store and our components
// reducers take in data (action and current state) and reduce it to a single object: the state
// reducers are functions with a switch statement that returns a new state based on the action type sent
// what sends info to our reducer? an action creator is sending a new action and creates an action
// action object to reducer to updated state

// the reducer below:
// we set up a switch that handles 5 action types
// we set the initial state
// in LOADING_GOALS, loading becomes true 

// in CREATE_GOAL, loading becomes false and goalsData is copied to a new object and goalsdata is set to the action.payload (the goal object, from our action creator)

// the first argument is state to set initial state
// object with a goalsData key pointing to an empty array
// object with a goalData key pointing to an empty array
// the second argument is action

// spread operator ...
// spread operator helps to include existing goals AND add a new goal
export default function goalsReducer(state = {
    loading: false,
    goalsData: [],

// For example: FETCH_GOALS:
// we are RETURNing a new version of that state
// we donâ€™t want goals to point to an empty array any longer
// we now want it to point to our fetch request data: goalsData: action.payload
// we are successfully updating our Redux store
